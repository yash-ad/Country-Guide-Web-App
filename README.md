# Country-Guide-Web-App
Developed a dynamic web application that retrieves and displays detailed information about countries using the Restcountries API. The app allows users to input a country name, fetches real-time data, and presents a comprehensive overview, including the country's flag, capital, continent, population, currency, and common languages.
